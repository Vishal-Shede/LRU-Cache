## 📘 Contents
1. **Notes.md** → Comprehensive notes on LRU Cache  
   - What is Cache?  
   - What is LRU?  
   - Real-world examples  
   - Operations (`get`, `put`)  
   - Different approaches (Array, LinkedList, HashMap+DLL)  
   - Time & space complexity comparison  

2. **Implementations**  
   - `LRUCacheDemo1.java` → Naive Approach 1 (ArrayList + timestamp)  
   - `LRUCacheDemo2.java` → Naive Approach 2 (Singly Linked List)  
   - `LRUCacheDemo3.java` → Optimal Approach (HashMap + Doubly Linked List)
